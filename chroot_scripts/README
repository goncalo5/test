A set of scripts to install the default Axiros chroot environments including all default modules and environment settings.

The standard one is make_chroot.sh - it should always work but there are others which can reduce your waiting time significantly.

Note: Please make sure you check out the whole chroot_scripts directory before running any of the scripts here.
